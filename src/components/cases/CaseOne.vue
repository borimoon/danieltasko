      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p class="text">
        Mi Műhely (roughly translates as 'We Workshop') is an architectural design studio founded by two talented young architects, András Nagy and Kornél Gáhy based in Hungary. They contacted us to design and develop a new website for them in November 2017.
      </p>

      <h4>My role and team</h4>
      <p>
        I primarily worked on UX thinking and also on visual design. My talented and hard-working teammate was Bori Tenger, who took part in UI design and did the whole front-end development.
      </p>

      <h3 class="article-heading">Discovery</h3>

      <p class="text">
        To kick off the project, we performed a competitive analysis. Then we conducted stakeholder and user interviews. We aspired to discover the whole journey the client goes through while building a house.
      </p>

      <p>For the user interviews, we selected people</p>

      <ul class="textlist">
        <li>
          who are considering to build their own home instead of buying one,
        </li>

        <li>
          who are in the middle of the house building process,
        </li>

        <li>
          who recently moved to their new house.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>We learned that —</h4>
      <ul class="text textlist">
        <li>
          András and Kornél see their work as continuous cooperation with their customers
        </li>

        <li>
          word of mouth recommendation is a critical decision factor when choosing an architect
        </li>

        <li>
          people have lots of negative experiences in the construction industry
        </li>

        <li>
          not surprisingly people prefer those architects whose portfolio is closer to their taste
        </li>

        <li>
          people think an architect will have one of the most significant impacts on the project
        </li>

        <li>
          cost is not a primary factor choosing an architect
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Key quote from the architects:</h4>
      <p class="text quote">
        <q>
          Design process is a collaboration with our client.
        </q>
      </p>

      <h4>Job to be done</h4>
      <p>
        We discovered that the primary goals of the website are to build trust, validate the professionalism of the architects and provide examples of their style. Also, the site should somehow reflect their approach to the architectural design process.
      </p>

      <h3 class="article-heading">Design</h3>

      <h4>Wireframes</h4>
      <p>
        As always, wireframes helped to create the structure of the site before we went ahead with the visual UI Design. The website consists of four main sections: the home page, the portfolio, the blog and the contact section.
      </p>

    <div class="article-content">
      <h4>Visual identity</h4>
      <p class="text">
        Parallel to wireframing, we started to build the visual identity. On the kick-off meeting, we learned that we had to start a design from scratch. The Mi műhely brand had no visual identity at all.
      </p>

      <h4>Logo design</h4>
      <p>
        For the early stage, we split the word “MI” (We) into primitive geometric shapes. Our first idea was to use the contrast of light-toned shapes and darker thin lines. Then through several iterations, the logo became something more simple and robust.
      </p>

      </div>

      <h4>Colours</h4>
      <p>
        Brand colours represent the appearance of the traditional architectural blueprints as well as the modern architectural plans.
      </p>

      </div>

      <h4>Detailed design</h4>
      <p>
        Plain white background, black text and grey coloured thick line were the leading design elements of the page. We used the blue colour to separate interactive game's shapes from other elements of the website.
      </p>

    <div class="article-content">
      <h3 class="article-heading">Challenge</h3>

      <p class="text">
        From research, we learned that the website should communicate the architects' "Let's create together" attitude. We knew that a simple USP sentence on a hero image would not do the job. We needed a more sophisticated way to represent this. Something interactive, which is connected to architecture and also amusing.
      </p>

      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <p class="text">
        After we held several brainstorming workshop and ideas (a rotatable 3D architectural object; a board where the user can draw), we came up with a plan to make a game, where users can build something. An old Chinese game, called the Tangram came to help us. This is a transformation puzzle made up of seven flat pieces, which are put together to form different shapes. The game aims to create a specific shape using all seven parts.<br>
        Meanwhile, we created the final version of the studio's logo, on which we worked parallel with the game's appearance. We sliced the logo into nine pieces, shuffled them on the landing screen, and gave it to our clients to try. They loved it.
      </p>

      <h3 class="article-heading">Learnings and result</h3>

      <p class="text">
        Through interviews, it was possible to validate some initial thoughts we had. But it was a big surprise to learn how crucial is the word of mouth recommendation in the construction industry (at least in Hungary).
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        The interactive game feature is being very well-received by clients of the Mi műhely. Mi műhely also organised a little competition for them. As a result, they received lots of wonderful artworks made of the shapes of their logo.
      </p>

      <h4>Our client's feedback</h4>
      <p class="quote">
        <q>
          Unfortunately, we can't react more sophisticated: this is a big YEEEAH!
        </q>
